# wdi lib

Writing our own library of useful functions

```
var list = [1,2,3,4,5];
wdi.shuffle(list)
```

Returns a shuffled copy of the list

```
wdi.sample(list)
wdi.sample(list, 3)
```

Produce a random sample from the list. Pass a number to return n random elements from the list. Otherwise a single random item will be returned.

```
wdi.each(list, func)
```

the each() method executes a provided function once per array element.

```
wdi.map(list, func)
```

Produces a new array of values by mapping each value in list through a transformation function

```
wdi.filter(list, func)
```

Looks through each value in the list, returning an array of all the values that pass a truth test
